_“Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”_

            \~Brundtland Commission Report, 1987.

Sustainable development, as a concept, came into being at the start of the 20th century. Over the years, it made its way into textbooks, conferences, environmental summits, vision, and mission of institutional ventures and developed into an overarching paradigm of the United Nations - Sustainable Development Goals 2030. Needless to say, we as a global community have not yet realized the need, depth, and span of a sustainable lifestyle, even at the expense of a human-borne global pandemic.

Understanding the exponential impact of our actions is important. Binge-watching Netflix for four hours per day over a month produces 53 kg carbon dioxide equivalent, i.e, an hour of quality video streaming needs 7 gigabytes of energy equivalent to 445 g carbon dioxide. Studies claim that an average person produces 4 tons of carbon per year globally. Coupled with the industrial release, we are looking into a future that is at least 4 to 5 degrees hotter by the end of this century.

While _sustainability_ can be divided into environmental, economic, and socio-cultural sections, _sustainable living_ encompasses the entire idea by scaling it down to an individual level. We can either wait for governments to ban plastics, Elon Musk to colonize Mars or make a decision to individually contribute to this global need of fixing the planet. Practicing sustainability does not require luxury, unlike what marketing baits today claim. Such practices are more economical but require patience and perseverance to inculcate down to our daily schedules.

Practicing minimalism is one way of ensuring that everything we own is used to its maximum potential. You may not be in a position to install solar panels, but you can do your part by making use of daylight or replacing CFL tubes with LED bulbs. Be that person who regularly filters your mails and virtual storage space to reduce energy consumption for data storage. Make it a practice to unplug electronic devices when not in use. Just switching off may not ensure electricity is not drawn unwantedly. Additions to your wardrobe can also be made from thrift stores and eco-friendly clothing. Veganism is not an absolute necessity for sustainability, but you can do your part by reducing your fish, poultry, and meat consumption. Buying a Tesla is not always affordable, but taking a walk or using a bicycle whenever possible is a check. Do the simple task of covering the utensil while cooking, and voila! You have saved 25% of your total energy usage.

We often undermine the power of small actions in making a big impact. The opposite is proved by the Dabba system workers in Mumbai who encouraged people to put a share sticker on their tiffins. This helped redistribute leftover food to the needy, transforming it from sixteen tons of food waste per day to zero food waste institution. You practise sustainability even by supporting ventures that promote it. Using the ECOSIA search engine can make you plant trees equivalent to your number of searches indirectly. Set your plans taking into consideration living in harmony with the planet. Many of the dos and don'ts are cliches but of impeccable relevance in this century.

If 7.674 billion _sustainabilists_ are born, we are exponentially closer to revitalizing the earth to its authenticity. Concern for the environment is not just something activists should have but everyone who are using its resources. Unshakable commitment to sustainability is not just buying _eco_ but choosing to do more good than less harm every single day. After all, one step at a time is the first change you can make.
