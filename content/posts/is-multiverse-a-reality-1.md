You would have probably heard the saying that there are seven people with the same face in the world. But what if I tell you that there could be infinite people with the same face? In the concept of a multiverse, there exists such a possibility. Now the question arises; are we living in a false reality? Some also believe that the soul never dies but rather it is just transferred from one parallel universe to another through wormholes; we don't know how souls get the address of wormholes though. The concept of the multiverse stems from the big bang theory — Albert Einstein's once controversial, but now widely accepted theory —  that the universe instantaneously expanded from a tiny point called a singularity.

Prof. Andrei Linde spoke to his audience in one of his lectures about the vastness of the cosmos described in the Hindu philosophy to draw a kind of similarity with his vision of the parallel universes. He described that according to the Hindu Purana ,Arjun was shaken with fright when the God Krishna, upon his request, showed him the awfully vast expanse of the cosmos.How surprisingly similar is the description of the parallel universe presented by Prof. Brian Green,in a lecture on Parallel Universe, to amuse his audience! “There are innumerable universes in the cosmos. Few of them could be almost the exact copy of our universe.”

Early recorded examples of the idea of infinite worlds existed in the philosophy of Ancient Greek Atomism, which proposed that infinite parallel worlds arose from the collision of atoms. In the third century BCE, the philosopher Chrysippus suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated, effectively suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time. The concept of multiple universes became more defined in the Middle Ages. The American philosopher and psychologist William James used the term "multiverse" in 1895 but in a different context. The term was first used in fiction and in its current physics context by Michael Moorcock in his 1963 sci-fi Adventures novella The Sundered Worlds (part of his Eternal Champion series).

Prof. Stephen Hawking's final research paper suggests that our Universe may be one of many similar to our own. The theory resolves a cosmic paradox of the late physicist's own making. It also points a way forward for astronomers to find evidence of the existence of parallel universes. The study was submitted to the Journal of High-Energy Physics 10 days before Prof Hawking passed. The new Hawking-Hertog assessment indicates that there can only be universes that have the same laws of physics as our own. Hawking predicted that our big bang was just one in an infinite number of big bangs that occurred simultaneously — each of them creating its own separate universe. Remember, if you are not suitable for doing your assigned job then you are just in the wrong universe, but in another universe, you are just what you want to be- President, actor, scientist or you might even be dead. Alternate reality may have a different version of you - the other you may look the same, but can have different aspirations. The possibilities are endless. Some scientists also think time travel is also a consequence of the Multiverse .

Real scientific theory explores, and in some cases supports, the case for universes outside, parallel to, or distant from but mirroring our own.Those bubble universes can't contact each other because they continue to expand indefinitely. If we were to set off for the edge of our bubble, where it might butt up against the next bubble universe over, we'd never reach it because the edge is zipping away from us faster than the speed of light, and faster than we could ever travel.

Science fiction loves the idea of a parallel universe, and the thought that we might be living just one of an infinite number of possible lives. Multiverses aren't reserved for "Star Trek," "Spiderman" and "Doctor Who," though. Why is  the MCU paying attention to the multiverse? Because you won't find as many stories elsewhere as in the multiverse, or infinity.

The physics community has debated the various multiverse theories over the years. Some physicists say the multiverse is not a legitimate topic of scientific inquiry. There may be uncountable versions of you living lives  that are slightly or totally different from your life in this world; you'd never know it. Your entire life might be repeated somewhere else in the universe, down to what you ate for breakfast yesterday to what you're going to do tomorrow. At least, that's the theory.
