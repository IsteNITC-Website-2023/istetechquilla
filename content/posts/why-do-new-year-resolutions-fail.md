January, the biggest motivation to start over. To be more precise it's actually the 1st of the month that is the biggest motivation. Yes! We are talking about the new year's resolution. This is one of the funniest things that people do. Because most of the motivations end even before the 31st of January.

  
New Year’s resolutions are kind of like a drunk uncle. You know you shouldn’t take him too seriously … but you can’t help but laugh and play along when he comes around once a year. So the question is why do new year's resolution fail? What exactly goes wrong in the process? Uncertainty would be the top answer I say.

  
Uncertainty about your goals creates room for indifference, confusion and distance between your goals and your aspirations. So clarify your goals prior to setting them. Ask yourselves some basic questions regarding your resolution. Like, "Why are they important to you? How would achieving these goals influence your life?"

  
The next one would be impatience. You may not see signs of progress as fast as you expect. This might lead you to think whether your goals are even valuable or not. Your goals may no longer seem achievable. So always have a deadline for the portion of the task you want to achieve and work accordingly.  
And then comes acceptance. Or maybe we can also call dedication. You may think you are interested in change, and you very well maybe, but are you ready? The chances are, if you’re setting new goals for yourself, you may be hungry for some level of change. You may find yourself making and taking every excuse that helps you step away from your path. This lack of connection, motivation, and dedication doesn’t mean that your goals aren’t representative of your dreams. It may simply mean that they are not the goals that matter the most to you at this present time. Make relevant goals. Goals that can answer questions like "Why am I doing this? Do I really want to do this? Is it a priority in my life right now?"

  
The best way to always achieve your goals is to look for the opportunities rather than the obligations in everything you do. It's never too late for change. Don't wait for January to start over. Today is your January.
