The Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE) is a national non-profit organization which advocates technical development and personal growth in creative and innovative ways. As the NIT Calicut studentsâ€™ chapter of ISTE, we aim at practising these values, not just preaching them, by conducting various events for students at school and college levels. After all, our motto is that growth happens over time, not overnight.

Techquila is our very own curated blog, with weekly articles giving insights to the world around us.
